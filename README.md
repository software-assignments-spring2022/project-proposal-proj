# Project Proposal

Notification Hub:
An application that allows notices or dates from multiple sites to be pooled into one place for ease of access. Can make multiple "buckets" to centralize notifications from school, work, or individual classes/projects into a single location.

For example, we need discord and the class website for this class. Essentially this would centralize any notifications from both of these places.

I mainly thought of this because CS classes tend to have 2-3 different websites per class that require checking to stay updated, and I am always worried I've forgot to check something and will miss a deadline.
